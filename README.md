# Child-Friendly Vocabulary Study Tool

## Overview

The **Child-Friendly Vocabulary Study Tool** is a simple and intuitive web application designed to help children study vocabulary words in an engaging and effective manner. Parents can upload a picture of vocabulary words and definitions, which the app processes using an in-browser OCR library. The child interacts with an interface that reads definitions aloud and allows them to type in the corresponding vocabulary word, receiving immediate feedback.

  - Accessibility Libraries: Ensuring the application is accessible to all users.

## Anticipated Roadblocks & Solutions

- **Text Extraction Inaccuracy**
  - **Issue:** OCR may misread text, especially in low-quality images.
  - **Solution:** Allow parents to review and correct extracted text before the study session begins.

- **Text-to-Speech Pronunciation Errors**
  - **Issue:** Some words may be mispronounced by the TTS engine.
  - **Solution:** Provide an option for parents to adjust pronunciations or input phonetic spellings.

- **Child Frustration with Incorrect Attempts**
  - **Issue:** Multiple incorrect attempts may discourage the child.
  - **Solution:** Limit the number of attempts and offer hints, such as revealing the first letter.

- **Technical Difficulties on Certain Devices**
  - **Issue:** Application may not function correctly on all devices or browsers.
  - **Solution:** Optimize for major browsers and devices, and provide recommendations for the best user experience.

- **Distractions from Excessive On-Screen Elements**
  - **Issue:** Too many features can overwhelm the child.
  - **Solution:** Keep the interface simple with only essential elements visible.

## Simplifications

- **No Account Creation Required**
  - Users can access and use the tool immediately without signing up or logging in.

- **Minimal Settings**
  - Default settings are optimized for most users, reducing complexity.
